# One Time Pad Encryption Software

Generate and encrypt messages using this one time pad software.

## What is a One Time Pad?

One Time Pad is a cipher technique where you use a unique random key for each message sent.
The key is a random string of letters which is as long as the message to be sent (100 is a good number) which both you and the recipient both have.

## Advantages of One Time Pad
One time pad is completely random which makes it very hard for an attacker to make connections over many messages, however is you use a one time pad key multiple times than that security is taken away
